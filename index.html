                <p>"And it's been an incredible legacy but JFK in particular, I think, captured the idealism, the
                    ability to imagine and remake America to meets its ideals, in a way we haven't seen before or
                    since...And I don't know of anyone who has had that same impact on a generation and inspired so many
                    people as JFK has."</p>
